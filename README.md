## üîß Project Description

This project implements a multi-stage **embedded escape room** using **STM32F3 Discovery Boards**, with each board acting as a unique challenge. Inspired by **Indiana Jones** and **arcade-style games**, users must solve a series of five interactive puzzles to advance through ‚Äúdoors‚Äù and reach the final challenge. All systems were developed in **modular C** using **STM32CubeIDE**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started

### Requirements

- STM32F3 Discovery Boards (x6)
- STM32CubeIDE
- USB cables
- Serial terminal (Cutecom / PuTTY)
- Breadboards, resistors, buttons, buzzer, sensors, LEDs, transistors

### Build Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Import challenge folders into STM32CubeIDE (`File > Import > Existing Projects`).
3. Build and flash code to STM32 boards.
4. Open a serial terminal (115200 baud) and interact with each challenge.

## üèÅ Integration and Flow

Players must **complete each puzzle** to progress through a sequence of five ‚Äúdoors.‚Äù  
Each STM32 board acts as one level. Upon solving a puzzle, the system:
- Provides success/failure feedback (LED, buzzer, motor)
- Sends or triggers the next challenge (via UART or external signal)

The storyline culminates in a **final pressure plate challenge**.
