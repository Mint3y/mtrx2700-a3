## üîß Project Description

This project implements a multi-stage **embedded escape room** using **STM32F3 Discovery Boards**, with each board acting as a unique challenge. Inspired by **Indiana Jones** and **arcade-style games**, users must solve a series of five interactive puzzles to advance through ‚Äúdoors‚Äù and reach the final challenge. All systems were developed in **modular C** using **STM32CubeIDE**.

### Breadboard Setup

The breadboard configuration uses 7 white LEDs and 1 red LED, each controlled via separate GPIO pins on the STM32 microcontroller:

- **White LEDs (PA1‚ÄìPA7):**
  - Each white LED is connected to an individual STM32 GPIO pin (PA1 through PA7).
  - Each LED is wired in series with its own resistor and NPN transistor.
  - The PAx pin (where x = 1‚Äì7) provides a small current to the transistor base, allowing a larger current to flow from the breadboard‚Äôs VCC rail, through the resistor and LED, then to ground.
  - This configuration offloads LED current from the microcontroller, preventing excessive draw on the STM32‚Äôs pins.

- **Red LED (PA15 ‚Äì Morse Code Output):**
  - The red LED is set up similarly, using a resistor and NPN transistor.
  - It is connected to PA15, which is mapped to the TIM2 timer peripheral for PWM or precise Morse code signaling in the code.
  - Again, the transistor switches current from the VCC supply through the LED and resistor to ground, triggered by the PA15 pin.

**Why transistors?**  
The STM32 can‚Äôt safely supply enough current to power multiple LEDs directly. Transistors act as switches, letting the board‚Äôs power rail supply the required current while only a small control signal is needed from the microcontroller.

**Wiring summary:**
- Each PAx pin ‚Üí 100Œ© resistor (base) ‚Üí NPN transistor base.
- Collector: VCC (after passing through ~100Œ© current-limiting resistor and LED).
- Emitter: Ground.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Architecture

- **Modular C** code (`.c/.h` files) with clear separation
- **Interrupt-driven UART** and **timers**
- **Function pointer callbacks** for modularity
- **Peripheral setup** (GPIO, ADC, PWM, I2C/SPI as needed)
- **Command parsing** via serial interface
- **3D-printed props** and physical interfaces for interactivity

## üèÅ Integration and Flow

Players must **complete each puzzle** to progress through a sequence of five ‚Äúdoors.‚Äù  
Each module acts as one level. Upon solving a puzzle, the system:
- Provides success/failure feedback (LED, buzzer, motor)
- Sends or triggers the next challenge (via UART or external signal)

The storyline culminates in a **final pressure plate challenge**.
