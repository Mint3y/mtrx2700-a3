## Meeting Summary
We brainstormed a bunch of ideas for our scavenger hunt. Ben had previously
suggested to include an Indiana Jones style boulder and a task where the
player has to swap out an idol/statue with a different object of similar
weight in order to 'steal' the treasure.

We setup a Google Doc to share our ideas and allocate work. After generating
various ideas we selected one per person and decided to combine them together
by creating the story that the player is in a dungeon and has to pass through
5 doors (5 challenges) to obtain a treasure.

## Work Allocation
- **James: Morse-Code Challenge.** Decode a morse code signal.
- **Oscar: Timer Challenge.** Similar to arcade tower stacking game.
- **Ben: Idol Challenge.** Pressure sensor challenge as explained above.
- **Marco: Control Challenge.** Control the path a ball takes down a slope.
- **Johnathan: Memory Challenge.** Simon Says with LEDs.

Two additional tasks will be done as a combined effort. **Riddles** begin the
dungeon explorer game and a **Visual Time Limit** will add pressure onto the
player.

We aim to get started on our individual modules by next week. Out of class
meetings will be organised next week as required.
