## Meeting Summary
Today was the 50% progress report. We summarised most of our completions in a
document and Johnathan submitted it on canvas. James and Oscar are essentially
done with their parts. Johnathan is working on 3D printing a housing for
Marco's board along with the physical connections and debugging of the memory
challenge. Marco spoke with the tutors last week and managed to get more work
done with the gyroscope. Ben is debugging his pressure plate.
